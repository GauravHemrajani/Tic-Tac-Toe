# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI

This project is a command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can play against an AI. The AI uses the minimax algorithm to make optimal moves. The game is implemented in Python and provides a simple and interactive way to play Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Features

- Play as either "X" or "O"
- The AI uses the minimax algorithm to make decisions
- Error handling for invalid moves
- Displays the game board after each move
- Provides the game result at the end (win, lose, or tie)

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GauravHemrajani/Tic-Tac-Toe.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd Tic-Tac-Toe
3. Run the game:
   python tictactoe.py

## How to Play
1. The game will ask you to choose your symbol (X or O).
2. The game will print the current state of the board.
3. If itâ€™s your turn, you will be prompted to enter your move. The format for entering a move is row,col (e.g., 1,2).
4. If you enter an invalid move (e.g., selecting an occupied cell or entering a position out of bounds), the game will ask you to try again.
5. The AI will take its turn after yours.
6. The game will continue until there's a winner or the board is full (tie).
